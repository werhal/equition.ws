                        <p>By choosing well-matched assets, an investor can construct a portfolio that will maximize returns for a given level of risk. 
                        Likewise, an investor can construct a portfolio with the lowest possible risk for a given desired level of return.
                        <p>In both cases, the investor maximizes the same value called 
                             <em>risk-adjusted return</em>. This metric shows how optimal the portfolio is.</p>

                            <p> <em>The higher the risk-adjusted return, the more generously the investor's risk 
                                is rewarded by the market.</em></p>
